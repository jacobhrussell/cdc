# Change Data Capture (CDC)

## Running Locally

These instructions assume you are using IntelliJ as your IDE.

Set your debug profile as `local` and start the local postgres container with `docker-compose up -d`.

## Endpoints

If you are using IntelliJ you can use the `http` directory for initiating local requests.

Create:

```shell
curl -X POST http://localhost:8080/book \
     -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
     -d '{
           "title": "The Great Gatsby"
         }' | jq
```

List all:

```shell
curl http://localhost:8080/book | jq
```

Find by id:

```shell
curl http://localhost:8080/book/1 | jq
```

Update:

```shell
curl -X PUT http://localhost:8080/book/1 \
     -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
     -d '{
           "title": "The Great Gatsby - Updated"
         }' | jq

```

Delete:

```shell
curl -X DELETE http://localhost:8080/book/1 | jq
```
